    <Info>	The tufted gray langur (Semnopithecus priam), also known as Madras gray langur, and Coromandel sacred langur, is an Old World monkey, one of the species of langurs. This, like other gray langurs, is mainly a leaf-eating monkey. It is found in southeast India and Sri Lanka. It is one of three Semnopithecus species named after characters from The Iliad, S. hector and S. ajax being the others. In Sinhala language, it is known as හැලි වදුරා (Heli wandura). Males are larger than females.[3] The average adult size for the species overall was a body mass of 12.8 kg (28 lb) and a head-to-body length of 61.1 cm (24.1 in). The Indian population is somewhat larger bodied than the Sri Lankan tufted gray langurs which typically are reported to weigh between 6.8 and 13.4 kg (15 and 30 lb). Despite its somewhat slighter size there, the Tufted gray langur is the largest native primate on Sri Lanka based on average sizes. In Sri Lankan subspecies, dorsal area gray to brownish gray in color, getting darker with the age. Underparts are light grayish. Short whitish beard and sideburns present. The hairs of the crown form a distinct pointed tuft or crest, that meets at a central point, hence the name. Black eyebrows project outward. Head scarcely paler or not paler than back. Hands and feet are same color as limbs.	</Info>

    <ImageUrl>Purplefacedlangur.jpg</ImageUrl>
    <Info>	The purple-faced langur (Semnopithecus vetulus),[1] also known as the purple-faced leaf monkey, is a species of Old World monkey that is endemic to Sri Lanka. The animal is a long-tailed arboreal species, identified by a mostly brown appearance, dark face (with paler lower face) and a very shy nature. The species was once highly prevalent, found in suburban Colombo and the "wet zone" villages (areas with high temperatures and high humidity throughout the year, whilst rain deluges occur during the monsoon seasons), but rapid urbanization has led to a significant decrease in the population level of the monkeys. It had traditionally been classified within the lutung genus Trachypithecus but was moved to the genus Semnopithecus based on DNA evidence indicating that is it more closely related to the gray langurs. It is known as ශ්‍රී ලංකා කලු වදුරා (Sri Lanka black monkey) in Sinhala. In the purple-faced langur, males are usually larger than females. Males measure 50 to 67.1 cm (19.7 to 26.4 in) in head-body length with a tail of 67 to 85.1 cm (26.4 to 33.5 in). Females possess a head-body length 44.7 to 60 cm (17.6 to 23.6 in) and tail length of 58.9 to 82 cm (23.2 to 32.3 in). The pelage may generally vary from blackish to grayish. The species tends to have whitish to gray short 'trousers' rounded off by purplish-black faces with white sideburns. Part of the back is covered with whitish fur, and tail is also furred with black and white mixed colors. The feet and hands are also purplish-black in color. Size varies among the subspecies. Typically adults will weigh somewhere between 3.1 and 11.4 kg (6.8 and 25.1 lb), averaging about 7.08 kg (15.6 lb). The smallest subspecies (S. v. nestor) commonly weighs between 3.8 and 6 kg (8.4 and 13.2 lb). Average weight from other subspecies has been recorded up to 7.8 kg (17 lb) in females and 8.5 kg (19 lb) in males with some exceptionally big langurs weighing up to perhaps 18 kg (40 lb). Among the primates that live in Sri Lanka, it is somewhat smaller than the tufted gray langur despite leading males of the group of purple-faced langurs often being larger than the tufted gray langur that lived together in the habitats. In the subspecies known as the "bear monkey" (S. v. monitcola) usually has a darker coat and usually sports a heavy mustache. In this species, the hair of crown directed backwards throughout, not radiating. it lacks the crest of tufted gray langurs and has hair on the crown no longer than on temples and nape. Purple-faced langurs have a rump that is pure white or whitish gray.	</Info>

    <Info>	The Nilgiri langur (Semnopithecus johnii) is a langur (a type of Old World monkey) found in the Nilgiri Hills of the Western Ghats in South India. Its range also includes Kodagu in Karnataka, Kodayar Hills in Tamil Nadu, and many other hilly areas in Kerala and Tamil Nadu. This primate has glossy black fur on its body and golden brown fur on its head. It is similar in size and long-tailed like the gray langurs. Females have a white patch of fur on the inner thigh. It typically lives in troops of nine to ten monkeys. Its diet consists of fruits, shoots and leaves. The species is classified as vulnerable due to habitat destruction and poaching for its fur and flesh, the latter believed to have aphrodisiac properties. The head-plus-body length is 78–80 cm in adult males and 58–60 cm in adult females, with the tail adding between 68.5 and 96.5 cm. The males weigh 9.1-14.8 kg, the females 10.9–12 kg. The gestation period is not precisely known but assumed to be similar to the closely related Hanuman Langur, i.e. 200 days.	</Info>

    <ImageUrl>Javanlutung.jpg</ImageUrl>
    <Info>	The Javan lutung (Trachypithecus auratus), also known as the ebony lutung and Javan langur, is an Old World monkey from the Colobinae subfamily. It is most commonly glossy black with a brownish tinge to its legs, sides, and "sideburns". It is found on and endemic to the island of Java, as well as on several of the surrounding Indonesian islands. The Latin word auratus in its scientific name means "golden", and refers to a less common color variant. Note that the common name golden langur is used for a different species. Like all langurs, this species' tail is noticeably long, measuring up to 98 cm in length while the body is only around 55 cm long. The two subspecies of this lutung are fairly similar in appearance and are geographically separated; males and females are both usually glossy black, although the females pale, yellowish white patch around the pubic area. Juveniles of both subspecies are orange in color.[5] The nominate subspecies Trachypithecus auratus auratus has a rare morph that does not lose its juvenile coloration when it matures, instead the coloration darkens slightly, with yellow tinges on its sides, limbs, and around its ears, and a black tinge on its back. The Javan lutung inhabits the interior and peripheral areas of rainforests. This primate is diurnal and arboreal. Its diet is primarily herbivorous, eating leaves, fruit, flowers, and flower buds, although it also eats insect larvae. As with other colobines, it has evolved a specialised stomach to digest plant material more efficiently. This species also has enlarged salivary glands to assist it in breaking down food. Like other langurs, the Javan lutung is a social animal, living in groups of around seven individuals, with one or two adult males in the group. Although they will look after offspring of other mothers as well as their own, adult females are aggressive towards females from other groups. The brighter coloring of juveniles may alert females to their presence and ensures that they will always be noticed and protected. This species has no discernible mating season and females produce one offspring at a time.	</Info>

    <Info>	The silvery lutung (Trachypithecus cristatus), also known as the silvered leaf monkey or the silvery langur, is an Old World monkey. It is arboreal, living in coastal, mangrove, and riverine forests in Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Borneo. It is the type of its species group. The silvery lutung is a medium-sized monkey with a long, non-prehensile tail. It has grey-tipped, dark brown or black fur, giving it a uniform silvery appearance. Unlike some related species, there are no paler markings on the face or body, except for a patch of whitish hair on the groin of females. A crest of fur runs along the top of the head, and the hair on the cheeks is long, often obscuring the ears. The hands and feet are hairless, with dark coloured skin, and have opposable thumbs and toes.Females range from 46 to 51 centimetres (18 to 20 in) in head-body length, with an average weight of 5.7 kilograms (13 lb) and a tail length of 67 to 75 centimetres (26 to 30 in). Males are slightly larger, from 50 to 58 centimetres (20 to 23 in) in length, with an average weight of 6.6 kilograms (15 lb) and a tail length of 67 to 75 centimetres (26 to 30 in). Like other langurs, the silvery lutung has a large three-chambered stomach to digest the cellulose found in its herbivorous diet. This allows for fermentation of food, and has some similarities with the stomach of ruminants. The intestine is unusually long, even compared to those of other langurs, and has a number of pouches along its length, which carry out further fermentation of plant matter. The teeth have grinding ridges and other modifications to allow the more efficient processing of tough leaves.	</Info>

The Trachypithecus obscurus are primate species that are found in the Peninsular region of Malaysia. Scan and sampling of 13 individuals (2 adult males, 8 adult females, 3 juveniles) was done by researchers from University Sains Malaysia. The researchers found that most of the dusky leaf monkeys spent their times positioning. The time that the dusky leaf monkey spent posting was estimated to be 40%. Researchers also found that the individuals spent approximately 33% of their time feeding on the leaves of the plants. In this research, researchers found these dusky leaf monkeys feeding on 10 different forest plant species on a regular basis. Dusky leaf monkeys tend to consume leaves which grow at higher elevations such as in the canopy level of a forest.	</Info>

Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. They are arboreal and gregarious by nature. A herd of capped langur consists of 2 to 14 langurs led by a brawny male langur. They are herbivorous, ingesting leaves, twigs, buds and fruits. There are four recognized subspecies of this lutung: Trachypithecus pileatus pileatus, Trachypithecus pileatus durga, Trachypithecus pileatus brahma and Trachypithecus pileatus tenebricus. A study of their diet in winter found that they spend nearly 40% of the day time feeding on leaves, flowers and fruits. Leaves contributed nearly 60% of the diet and they foraged on as many as 43 different plant species.	</Info>

    <ImageUrl>Francoislangur.jpg</ImageUrl>
    <Info>	The François' langur (Trachypithecus francoisi), also known as the Francois' leaf monkey, Tonkin leaf monkey, or white side-burned black langur is a species of lutung and the type species of its species group. It is one of the least studied of the species belonging to the Colobinae subfamily. The species is distributed from Southwestern China to northeastern Vietnam. The total number of wild individuals is unknown, but fewer than 500 are believed to be left in Vietnam and 1,400–1,650 in China. About 60 langurs are in captivity in North American zoos. The species is named after Auguste François (1857–1935), who was the French Consul at Lungchow in southern China. François' langur is a medium-sized primate with black, silky hair. It has very distinct white sideburns that grow down from its ears to the corners of its cheeks. A morphological specialization of François' langur is its complex stomach, made up of four separate chambers. This is a necessary adaptation for the digestion of its folivorous diet. This species shows sexual dimorphism in its size. Males have a head-body length of 55–64 cm (22–25 in), while females are only 47–59 cm (19–23 in) in length. Males likewise have longer tails of 82–96 cm (32–38 in) compared to the 74–89 cm (29–35 in) for females. Males are significantly heavier than females, weighing 6.5–7.2 kg (14–16 lb) compared to 5.5–5.9 kg (12–13 lb) for females. Infants weigh 0.45–0.50 kg (16–18 oz) at birth. Infants are born with bright orange coloured fur, which fades to black throughout the period of infancy lasting several months. It isn't known why their coats are so conspicuous, but current hypotheses suggest it may elicit attention, protection and caregiving by adults. François' langur has large salivary glands to begin the digestion of tough leaf fibers. A more notable evolutionary adaptation seen in this langur is the sacculated stomach with two chambers. In the upper chamber, bacteria help to continue the breakdown of fibers started by the saliva. The upper chamber has a relatively normal pH, to create favorable conditions for bacterial growth. The lower chamber is similar to that of other mammals, in that it contains the acids that finish the breakdown of food components.	</Info>

    <Info>	The Hatinh langur (Trachypithecus hatinhensis)[3] is a highly threatened Old World monkey found in limestone forests in Vietnam, primarily in the Quảng Bình Province. A recent survey discovered a small population living in the Quảng Trị Province. Contrary to its name, it is not known from the Hà Tĩnh Province. The local Van Kieu minority refer to this lutung as the 'Con Cung', which roughly translates as "black, cliff-dwelling monkey with a long tail". It resembles the closely related François' langur (T. francoisi), but its white cheek-stripes typically extend behind the ears onto the nape (there are significant individual variations, however), and the overall black colour is non-glossy and has a brownish tinge. This diurnal, largely arboreal langur is social and typically seen in groups of 2-15, but occasionally groups may number as many as 30 individuals. It has often been considered a subspecies of the François' langur, but was elevated to a full species by Bradon-Jones in 1995, and this was followed by Groves, 2005. Both, however, listed it as a subspecies in 2004, and genetic work suggest it should be considered a subspecies of the Laotian langur (T. laotum). Morphological and genetic data also suggests the Indochinese black langur (T. ebenus) is a morph of the Hatinh langur.	</Info>

    <Info>	The white-headed langur (Trachypithecus poliocephalus) is a critically endangered langur. Two subspecies are recognized: T. p. poliocephalus in Cát Bà Island, Vietnam, and T. p. leucocephalus in Guangxi, China. The former (the nominate subspecies), often known as the golden-headed or Cat Ba langur, is among the rarest primates in the world, and possibly the rarest primate in Asia, with population size estimated at less than 70 individuals. Both subspecies are overall blackish, but the crown, cheeks and neck are yellowish in T. p. poliocephalus, while they are white in T. p. leucocephalus, as suggested by its scientific name. According to the Cat Ba Langur Conservation Project, the Cat Ba langur's skin is black and the pelage color is dark brown; head and shoulder are bright golden to yellowish-white. The tail is very long (ca. 85 cm) compared with the body size (ca. 50 cm). Babies are colored golden-orange; the pelage starts to change its color from about the fourth month on. Males and females look alike. Two adult females captured during translocation in 2012 weighted slightly more than 9 kilograms each. The Cat Ba Langur, which lives on Cat Ba Island in Vietnam, is one of the 25 most endangered primates. Conservation efforts are helping to prevent this, however, and have greatly increased their population since 2003, when there were only 40. Until recently, the Cat Ba Langur was not considered a species but rather a subspecies of other Langurs that live in the Vietnam jungles. Cat Ba Langurs are diurnal creatures and travel in groups of about four to eighteen animals. They prefer the steep limestone cliffs that make up most of Cat Ba Island. Most of the places that they are found are not accessible to humans by foot. Cat Ba Langurs spend around 66% of their time resting and the rest moving, foraging, and socializing, with the distribution changing between summer and winter. They eat less and rest more in the winter and the opposite in the summer.	</Info>

It is considered to be one of the world's most endangered primate species. It is named for French-American ornithologist Jean Théodore Delacour. Delacour's langur is somewhat larger than its two closest relatives, François' langur and the Laotian langur, but in other respects has a similar appearance. Adults measure from 57 to 62 cm (22 to 24 in) in head-body length, with a tail 82 to 88 mm (3.2 to 3.5 in) long. Males weigh between 7.5 and 10.5 kg (17 and 23 lb), while the females are slightly smaller, weighing between 6.2 and 9.2 kg (14 and 20 lb). Their fur is predominantly black, with white markings on the face and distinctive creamy-white fur over the rump and the outer thighs, while females also have a patch of pale fur in the pubic area. Like other closely related lutungs, Delacour's langur has a crest of long, upright, hair over the forehead and crown; this is, however, somewhat taller and narrower than in other species.	</Info>

    <Info>	The Indochinese black langur (Trachypithecus ebenus) is a poorly known lutung native to Laos and adjacent Vietnam. It was originally described as a subspecies of T. auratus, but was later found to be a member of the T. francoisi group, with some maintaining it as a subspecies of that species. In 2001, it was recommended treating it as a separate species.Except for its almost entirely black pelage, it resembles the other members of the T. francoisi group. Uniquely in this group, it and the related T. hatinhensis appear to be parapatric, T. ebenus showing what appears to be signs of intergradation with T. hatinhensis are known, and genetically the two barely are separable. This has led to suggestions that it may be a black morph of that taxon, which in turn possibly should be considered a subspecies of T. laotum.A survey that included 67 T. hatinhensis revealed a high level of variation in the amount of white to the head, and ebenus was maintained as a morph. It was formerly considered data deficient by IUCN, but they now include it in the endangered T. hatinhensis.	</Info>

    <Info>	The banded surili (Presbytis femoralis), also known as the banded leaf monkey or banded langur, is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to the Thai-Malay Peninsula and the Indonesia island of Sumatra. It is threatened by habitat loss. The banded surili is 432 to 610 millimetres (17.0 to 24.0 in) long, excluding the tail, with a tail length of 610 to 838 millimetres (24.0 to 33.0 in). It weighs 5.9 to 8.2 kilograms (13 to 18 lb). It has dark fur on the back and sides with lighter fur on the underside. P. f. femoralis, sometimes known as Raffles' banded langur, has particularly dark fur on top and particularly white fur on the belly. P. f. robinsoni, sometimes known as Robinson's banded langur, is more grey on the underside.	</Info>

    <Info>	The Sarawak surili (Presbytis chrysomelas) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae. It is endemic to the southeast Asian island of Borneo, where it is distributed north of the Kapuas River in Kalimantan, Indonesia, the Malaysia states of Sarawak and Sabah, and in Brunei. Its taxonomy is complex and disputed, and it has been considered a subspecies of P. femoralis or P. melalophos. The Sarawak surili was formerly considered common, but has declined drastically due to persecution and habitat loss, and as of 2008 is only known from five sites with a combined population of 200–500 individuals. Consequently, it is believed to be one of the rarest primates in the world, and has been rated as critically endangered by IUCN.	</Info>

It is endemic to the large international island of Borneo, in Indonesia, Malaysia, and possibly Brunei. Its body is mainly grey-brown, with a distinct white spot on the forehead. Its chin and lower cheeks are greyish. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. The white-fronted surili has a tall sagittal crest that leans forward. This species' dorsal body is mainly greyish brown and ventral side is yellowish brown in coloration, with a distinct white spot on the forehead. The tail is yellowish grey, with blackish coloration of hands, feet, brow, crown crest and cheeks. There is light colored frontal patch on the crown crest. This species has a sacculated stomach to assist in the breakdown of cellulose and also has enlarged salivary glands. The incisors are narrow and the molars have a sharp, high crest. The jaw is deep and the face is short and broad. The thumb is reduced and the hindlimbs are longer than the forelimbs. The average body mass for the adult male is 5.67 kg and for adult females is 5.56 kg. There are two subspecies, P. f. frontata and P. f. nudifrons. P. f. frontata is brownish in colour, with darker arms, legs, top and sides of the head and tail. The chin and lower cheeks are greyish. The white spot on the forehead is roughly triangular in shape. Meanwhile, P. f. nudifrons is dark greyish with blackish hands, feet and base of tail. The underparts and distal end of tail are paler grey-brown with white throat. The white spot on the forehead is rather square compare to P. f. frontata and is divided by a vertical line of short black hairs.	</Info>

    <Info>	Hose's langur (Presbytis hosei) is a species of primate in the family Cercopithecidae endemic to the island of Borneo, including Brunei, Kalimantan (Indonesia), and East Malaysia. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It is threatened by habitat loss. It was first identified in Kutai National Park and Sangkulirang Peninsula, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 1985. Miller's grizzled langur, a subspecies, is very rare and had been thought to be extinct, until it's 'rediscovery' in January 2012. Populations of Miller's grizzled langurs were first described in Kutai National Park and Sangkulirang Peninsula, East Kalimantan, Indonesia, in 1985. In the past, these primates had been hunted for their meat and occasional bezoar stones. Together with loss of natural habitats, these populations have declined. An international team of scientists from Indonesia, the United States, Canada, and the Czech Republic have studied this new population and published their findings in the American Journal of Primatology. Scientists had set up time-lapse recording equipment in the Wehea Forest of the eastern tip of Borneo island, in June 2011. They discovered in over 4,000 of their images, the primate, which was so rare, scientists had to verify from old pictures what they had discovered. This area of forest is apparently outside of the primates' previous known range, being north-eastern part of Borneo, as well as the islands of Sumatra and Java and the Thai-Malay peninsula.	</Info>

    <Info>	The maroon langur, maroon leaf monkey, or red leaf monkey (Presbytis rubicunda) belongs within the order Primate and the family Cercopithecidae. It is found on the southeast Asian island of Borneo and the nearby smaller Karimata. P. rubicunda mostly live in forests at altitudes below 2,000 m. They feed on leaves (36%). Red Leaf monkeys (Presbytis rubicunda) are found in Southeast Asia. Red Leaf monkeys are endemic to the island of Borneo. Their habitat is dense and has dipterocarp evergreens. Borneo has a healthy tropical rainforest. This island is not only made up of the tropical rainforest, but it also contains shallow swampy areas that is made up of sod containing acidic, decomposed plant matter. The swamp amalgamated along with the rivers nearby. These swampy areas have their seasonal bouts of dry weather but when the wet season comes about, the rivers rises around 2 meters. Red Leaf monkeys are arboreal primates and spend most of their time in the canopy. They also have a large home ranges and low population densities compared to other primates. This is believed to be because they rely on specific trees which are rare and widely dispersed.	</Info>
